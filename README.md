# Portfolio
A simple webapp for my personal webspace. 

## Structure
The site is a static webapp hosted on Azure. It is automatically redeployed when the mainbranch of this repo gets updated. This [Quickstart Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started) is a great starting point for doing your own.

Webapp content is currently minimal, but I hope to expand upon it now that I have the infrastructure working. It is connected to my personal domain and operates as travel signpost for people looking for me.
